# About 

This website demonstrates some possibilities for transforming a wall-mounted museum exhibit into the visual storytelling format of a website. 

The original exhibit was on display in the Fall of 2025 at the [Maxwell Museum of Anthropology](https://maxwellmuseum.unm.edu/) on the campus of the University of New Mexico.
